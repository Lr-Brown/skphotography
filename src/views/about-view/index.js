          <SHeader> Meet Sharon Katrice Brown</SHeader>

            A lifelong hobby that has become a profession, Sharon Katrice
            Photography is the culmination of a dream, self-confidence, and
            determination. My personal journey with mindfulness has helped me
            gain the confidence and motivation needed to bring this business
            venture to fruition.

            Iâ€™ve been taking pictures since elementary school--always the one
            with the camera snapping pics and documenting memories throughout
            the years. I was blessed with the gift of making others smile and
            feel comfortable in front of the camera. After capturing your
            memories, I enjoy creating personalized keepsakes.

            mother of three amazing young adults and three adorable fur babies.
